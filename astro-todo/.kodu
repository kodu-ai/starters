This project showcases a minimal and modern to-do app designed as a personal learning exercise, built using a cutting-edge tech stack that includes React, Astro, and Shadcn UI. The app allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by providing essential features such as the ability to quickly add tasks via a user-friendly input field and effortlessly delete them with a single click. Utilizing Astro for project structure and static site generation, the app leverages React to create dynamic and interactive components. Shadcn UI offers modern, pre-designed UI elements that enhance the user experience, while Tailwind CSS provides a flexible and stylish design framework. The project structure is neatly organized, with static files located in the public directory, React components in the src/components folder, Astro pages in src/pages, and global styles managed in src/styles. To set up the app locally, users can clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the development server. When ready for deployment, the app can be built for production and previewed locally, demonstrating its seamless integration of modern technologies to create a simple yet clean and usable to-do list web application.
